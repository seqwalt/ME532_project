# Cardiovascular Disease Classification

This is a project for ECE 532: Matrix Methods in Machine Learning at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The purpose is to perform a classification task on a public dataset.

## Dataset: [Cardiovascular diseases dataset (clean)](https://www.kaggle.com/aiaiaidavid/cardio-data-dv13032020)

This dataset provides 12 features, including if the patient has the disease. There are 68,783 patients in the dataset.

## Algorithms: Least Squares (LS), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN)

*Classification*: The feature data will be used in LS and SVM classifiers.  For the LS method,  I may have to consider regularization if there is too much linear dependance within the feature set.  I will compare these results with a neural network (NN) approach. The NN is expected to have the best result of all the classifiers because it can approximate any classifier boundary.  Cross validation will be used to measure success.
